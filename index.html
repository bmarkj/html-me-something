                    <h3>George Rogers</h3>
                    <p>George Rogers was the number 1 overall pick in the NFL draft in 1981. A product of the University of South Carolina, 
                        Rogers won the Heisman Trophy and went on to lead the NFL in rushing in 1981 with 1,674 yards--a record for a NFL rookie, 
                        and a single-season record that still stands for the New Orleans franchise.  Rogers also scored 13 touchdowns that year, was
                        named Rookie of the Year, and was selected to the Pro Bowl.</p>
                    <p>Rogers was traded to the Washington Redskins in 1985 and played three more seasons. In 1986 he led the NFL in rushing 
                        touchdowns (18).  Despite playing only four years in New Orleans, he still ranks second all-time in franchise history in 
                        rushing with 995 carries for 4,267 yards and 23 touchdowns. Rogers was named first team All-Pro in 1981 and earned Pro Bowl 
                        honors in 1981 and 1982. He was inducted into the Saints Hall of Fame in 1992.</p>

                    <h3>Ricky Williams</h3>
                    <p>On April 17th, 1999, the New Orleans Saints dealt their entire draft (8 picks) for the rights to select Ricky Williams with the 
                        #5 pick of the first round. Williams came from the University of Texas Longhorn program where he set the NCAA record for rushing 
                        yards in 1998 and won the Heisman Trophy. Williams had a disappointing rookie season due to various injuries that limited him to 
                        884 rushing yards and two touchdowns in 12 games, and because he alienated his teammates with his off-field behavior. At the end 
                        of the season, the Saints fired their Head Coach, Mike Ditka, who was responsible for the preceeding year's draft debacle, and 
                        Williams publicly expressed his resentment towards both Ditka and the franchise. However, he rebounded with 1,000 or more rushing 
                        yards in each of the next two seasons.</p>
                    <p>Trouble continued to swirl around the Saints' star running back as Williams began talking of switching from football to baseball. As 
                        a precautionary move, the Saints drafted another runnning back, Deuce McAlister, in the 2001 draft. This resulted in further tension 
                        between Williams and the Saints, and he was traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2002 in exchange for 3 draft picks over the next 2 years.  </p>

                    <h3>Deuce McAllister</h3>
                    <p>"Deuce", a name that is almost synonymous with the New Orleans Saints in the eyes of loyal fans, was selected in the first round of 
                        the 2001 NFL draft after a college stint with the Ole Miss Rebels. On the surface it seemed an odd pick since the Saints already had 
                        a Heisman-Trophy running back, Ricky Williams, on their roster. But relations with Williams had been souring and New Orleans wanted
                        a new face.  By 2002, McAllister's second season with the Saints, Williams was gone and it was Deuce's team. He rushed for a NFC-leading
                        1,388 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns, and caught 47 passes for 352 yards and three scores. At the end of the year he was ranked sixth 
                        in the NFL in rushing yards and earned Pro Bowl honors.  In 2003, he was even better, starting all 16 games for the only time in his 
                        career. He rushed for 1,641 yards, fourth in the league, and scored eight touchdowns and caught a career-high 69 passes for 516 yards 
                        as he made another Pro Bowl. The 1,641 yards were the second most in a single season in team history.</p>
                    <p> McAllister was part of the team that reached the NFC Championship game in 2006. He was so revered by the organization that they 
                        re-signed him in 2009 for the playoffs. While he was never activated, he was allowed to lead the team onto the field in the playoffs 
                        and was rewarded with a Super Bowl ring for the team's one and only Super Bowl championship. McAllister is the leading rusher in franchise 
                        history with 1,429 carries for 6,096 yards. His 49 rushing touchdowns are the most in franchise history and he is second all-time in 
                        touchdowns in franchise history with 55. He led the team in rushing in four different seasons and holds the team record with 27 games 
                        of 100 or more rushing yards. McAllister was inducted into the Saints Hall of Fame in 2012. Deuce. In New Orleans that means Saints!</p>

                    <h3>Reggie Bush</h3>
                    <p>Reggie Bush played college football at USC where, during the 2005 season, he amassed 2,611 all-purpose yards, scored 18 touchdowns, and won
                        the Heisman Trpophy as the most outstanding player in the nation. During his collegiate career Bush racked up 6,890 all-purpose yards and was 
                        twice named a consensus All-American.</p>
                    <p>In January 2006, Bush declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft and the New Orleans Saints selected him as the second overall pick that
                        year. Bush's arrival was much heralded in New Orleans, but his tenure there was marked by inconsistency and later by controversy over allegations 
                        of improperly receiving gifts while at USC which resulted in him forfeiting his Heisman Trophy.  Bush was named an All-Pro in 2008 and was part of 
                        the Saints team that won Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 over the Indianapolis Colts. In 2011 Bush was traded to the Miami Dolphins.</p>

                    <h3>Mark Ingrahm</h3>
                    <p>After three years as the premier running back for the Crimson Tide of Alabama, Mark Ingrahm declared his eligibility for the NFL draft in January of
                        2011, and was selected in the first round by the New Orleans Saints. His rookie season was marred by injuries and he finished the season with only 
                        474 rushing yards and five touchdowns. In the succeeding years, Ingrahm developed a well-deserved reputation for explosive power and a physically
                        punishing running style. His performance earned him an extension to his rookie contract, and he is part of the Saints' current running back duo, along
                        with Alvin Kamara. Over his 8 seasons in New Orleans, Ingrahm has racked up 5,802 rushing yards and 1,562 receiving yards.</p>

                    <h3>Alvin Kamara</h3>
                    <p>Alvin Kamara is the newest addition to the Saints' stable of running backs, but he brings a twist--he can be used equally well as a reciever out of the
                        back field.  This is something the Saints saw and began to develop in Reggie Bush, but Kamara is the one who has put it together seamlesly. After a short 
                        stint at Alabama where he suffered a knee injury, Kamara transferred to the University of Tennessee and played two years for the Vols.  He declared for the 
                        NFL draft in 2017 after amassing 2000 yards rushing and averaging a touchdown per game.</p>
                    <p>The New Orleans Saints drafted Kamara in the third round and since then he has split backfield duties with Mark Ingrahm.  The duo has terrorized NFL defenses 
                        ever since. Kamara's 728 rushing yards and 826 receiving yards represented teh first 700/700 season in Saints history, while Ingrahm mached those numbers 
                        making them the first running back duo ever to both rack up 1,500 total yards from scrimmage.  Kamara's outstanding play earned him the NFL Offensive Rookie 
                        of the Year honors. Among non-quarterbacks with 100+ carries, his 6.07 yards per rush was the most ever by an NFL rookie, any Saints player, and the third 
                        most by any NFL player since 1980.</p>
